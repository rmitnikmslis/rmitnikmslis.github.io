      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a student at the Pratt Institute School of Information with interests in Archives, Research Librarianship, and Special Collections. My research interests include [critical] information literacy, critical pedagogy, archives, preserving cultural heritage, affect, addressing library and academic anxiety, organized labor, social reproduction theory, ethics of care, and working with multilingual materials. My passion for libraries is grounded in the library as “the commons” as an ideal in a world where the material reality is that access to information is commodified under neoliberalist capitalism, prioritizing slow and thoughtful engagement and exploration with research inside the classroom, and the joy of lifelong learning in dialogue with meaningful instruction.</p>
<p>I earned a BA in Russian (Language and Literature) from CUNY Hunter College and completed graduate coursework towards an Advanced Certificate in Labor Studies as a Union Semester participant from the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies. I was born and raised in deep southern Brooklyn. When I’m not going down a research rabbithole, I am listening and dancing to moody synthesizers, post-punk, disco, klezmer, and “World Music” and finding occasions to hear them live; trying to be an active film viewer at one of this movie town’s great repertory and arthouse cinemas; swimming at Coney Island; and making friends and unsuspecting strangers laugh.</p>
